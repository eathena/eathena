1. About eAthena
---------
eAthena is an open-source project, emulating a Ragnarok Online Server. It is written in C and is currently version controlled
via SVN & GIT. eAthena currently runs on most common Operating Systems currently available today.


2. Requirements
---------

* Hardware Requirements

eAthena requires the following resources from the machine in order to function without problems or the common "lag":
  * 1.5 GHz or faster CPU, either Intel or AMD is acceptable. Some members have reported that they have gotten eAthena to run on other processors.
  * 512 MB of RAM, MINIMUM. The map server in an idle state consumes about 150-200MB of RAM, depending on how many maps and NPC's are loaded.
  * A video card powerful enough to run the Operating System of your choice. eAthena is a console based software, which means that all that is required to run it is a console or command access.
  * Fast internet or network connection. This is very hard to predict. A lot of questions arise that ask 'how much bandwidth does eAthena need?'. There is no answer to that. It is all depending on how many characters are connected, from where, and what they do while connected to the server.
  * 250MB of Hard Drive space or better, up-to 1GB depending on how big the database may get.
  
* Software Requirements

eAthena, depending on what you plan to do with it and what platform you run it on, will require, at a minimum, the following:
  * GCC compatible compiler
  * zlib
  * MySQL or MySQL libs(if using SQL for your databases)
  * SVN/GIT (if using self-compiled packages)
