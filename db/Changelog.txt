2005/07/13

	  purpose, right? [Skotlex]

	  as drops to new cards (thanks to MasterOfMuppets), fixed Taoist Card

2005/06/18
	* Reverted Skotlex's work. [Lupus]
	  all 3 Lances differ by their ID (for quests purposes!)
	  There are 2 assassin masks: 5054 and 5096. They don't have any slots.
	  But they differ by applicable jobs: 5054 for Assassins + Priest Class
		and 5096 is for ANY Thief Class (Thief,Assassin,Roug) + Priest Class
		Plz, if you want, use ITEM_DB2.TXT for made-up items 8)
	-- I can't argue on the assassin mask, and it's good that it was fixed. But
	  which quest uses the Lance (1411)? It must be a quest that is not
	  currently shipped with eA, because items 1411 and 1412 are NOT used
	  anywhere inside the NPC directory, and 1410 is only on some shops. I am
	  curious to know which Quest uses the 1411 lance... 
	  Plus it doesn't seems to make any sense from a client-side view. "You
	  need the Lance that Doppel Drops, not another" (even thought they all
	  look and work exactly the same for the player x.X) [Skotlex]
	* Changed slot-count for item 1411 (Lance_) from 0 to 1. [Skotlex]
	  I am not going to believe 0 is the real number for it considering that:
	  1: You can't get it from any shop. (that id is nowhere in the npc files)
	  2: Only DoppelGanger drops it, with a 5.5% chance.
	* Added some new items (by Landarma), fixed recently added ones. [Lupus]
2005/06/11
	* Changed Ungoliatnt Assumption skill's target to self from target [Skotlex]

	* Added the new headgears and garments [DracoRPG]
2005/06/09
	* Added inf2=64 to Benedictio. 64 now actually stands for "skill needs
	  other nearby support characters", or as the battle_config calls it
	  "ensemble skills". [Skotlex]
	* Removed inf2 of Extremity Fist, it is harcoded for now. Inf2 values 4 and
	  8 are free for the taking. What should they be for? Partner/Baby skills? [Skotlex]
	* Added inf2 values: 32 (Dance/Song skills) & 64 (Encore skills).
	  (Encore skills don't need to be set as 96) [Skotlex]:
	  - Bard Skills set to inf2 32: BA_WHISTLE, BA_ASSASSINCROSS, BA_POEMBRAGI, BA_APPLEIDUN
	  - Dancer Skills set to inf2 32: DC_HUMMING, DC_DONTFORGETME,
	  DC_SERVICEFORYOU, DC_UGLYDANCE
	  - Encore Skills set to inf2 64: BD_LULLABY, BD_RICHMANKIM,
	  BD_DRUMBATTLEFIELD, BD_RINGNIBELUL, BD_INTOABYSS, BD_SIEGFRIED
	  - If I missed any skill, help me correct it, these inf2 values are not yet
	  used in the code, but that'll change soon.
	* Added inf2 value 16 for Guild Skills, set all guild skills to have inf2
	* Readded skills to items Electric Guitar, Firebrand & Ice Falchion [Skotlex]
	* Some corrections to the skill_db.txt's nk value. [Skotlex]
	  - Storm Gust: 1->0
	  - Blitz-Beat: 1->2
	* Removed magnum break's inf2=16 since it ain't used anywhere. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Ayothaya monsters drops and names thx 2 MasterOfMuppets [Lupus]
2005/06/06
	* Corrected Ice Falchion, Firebrand, Electric Guitar [Skotlex]
	  These should not give you a skill-tree, only auto-cast the skill.
	  Ice Falc also has a 1% chance of freezing yourself.
	* Removed the 20% HP cost of casting GrandCross.
2005/06/05
	* Changed Grandcross/DarkCross's Interval from 300ms to 400ms [Skotlex]

	* Added the new column to item_db: refineable to specify which items can be refined. [Skotlex]
	* Fixed Novices able to wear all "Every class except Novice" headgears, thanks to duduc [DracoRPG]
2005/05/28
	* Added emotion constants to const.txt	[Skotlex - R1853]
	  The constants mirror their command counter part (ie: /meh -> e_meh),
	  for the most part, except for the following:
	  e_gasp (/!), e_what (/?), e_cash (/$), e_dots (/...), e_no (/??),
	  e_hp (need HP), e_hlp (/hp, help emotion),
	  e_scissors (ctrl+-), e_rock (ctrl+=), e_paper (ctrl+\)
	  And the following flag-emotions are available:
	  e_korea, e_indonesia, e_philippines, e_usa, e_brazil
	  The whole point is being able to do in scripts "emotion e_wah;" instead
	  of "emotion 16;"
