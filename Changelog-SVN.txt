	Fix to map makefile

2005-10-09:
        Fixed a cart-dupe bug in char-server, and added new feature:
         set max_connect_users to a negative value to allow only GMs of
         the level configured to bypass the limit in.

2005-10-08:
	Login server added but in a different folder called login_sql/
	has its own makefile, but can be compiled in the same root folder
	this is our last fix for the login server, and will be converting to EAPP
	since that is where i've done most of my work =D
	
	expect better performance, and real help from a real programmer Shinomori and Arutema.
